Tests for a Fortran wrapper

These are some tests for a Fortran wrapper in order to access some QE subroutines and functions from Python.
The wrapper Fortran file is compiled with f2py, using the following command:

f2py3 -c functwrapper.f90 -m pyfunct -I/home/mauropalumbo/espresso-6.1/Modules/ -I/home/mauropalumbo/espresso-6.1/clib/ -llapack -lblas libqemod.a clib.a libqefft.a  libpw.a libqela.a libiotk.a

It needs the following QE library (compiled as shared libraries with the option -fPIC both for the fortran and C compilers in the QE makefile):
libqemod.a clib.a libqefft.a  libpw.a libqela.a libiotk.a

It also need lapack and blas libraries installed in your system.
